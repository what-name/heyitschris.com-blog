      <description>How it&amp;rsquo;s made: This Blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to have a blog. Putting my thoughts into writing has always benefitted me and I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely started paying more attention to do it as often as I can. After I completed Forrest Brazeal&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Resume Challange and had my own website running on Serverless AWS, I thought why not extend it with a blog. I wrote some articles on my Medium page as well, but seeing #100DaysOfCode &amp;amp; #100DaysOfCloud take off, I decided it&amp;rsquo;s time to make my own.</description>

      <description>About Chris Nagy 👋🏻 Hello there [general kenobi]! My name is Chris Nagy and I have a passion for all things that run on electricity. Batteries🔋, electric vehicles🚗, solar panels🌞, computers💻, phones📱 and the thing that ties it all together; code⌨️.
I travelled the world for the past 2 years (🇹🇭🇵🇭🇺🇸🇭🇰🇲🇴🇦🇪🇬🇧🇮🇩) and taught english in China🇨🇳 as well. I&amp;rsquo;m a supporter of the conscious consumption and use of psychedelics🍄 in order to better understand ourselves and our society.</description>
