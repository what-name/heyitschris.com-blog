The problem was however that the main page loaded no problem, but anything in /posts/this-post would get an AccessDenied error. While I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out why this problem exists, I did make it work and now I&amp;rsquo;m sharing the setup here since there is no clear-cut guide on Hugo for this setup.</description></item><item><title>How it's made: This Blog</title><link>https://blog.heyitschris.com/posts/a-blog-post-about-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 16:12:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.heyitschris.com/posts/a-blog-post-about-my-blog/</guid><description>How it&amp;rsquo;s made: This Blog.

After I completed Forrest Brazeal&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Resume Challange and had my own website running on Serverless AWS, I thought why not extend it with a blog.

⚠️Update This was initially published on Medium. Since I created my own blog, I saw no reason not to migrate this post to this platform. Since this post was published, I have fixed all the small issues on the infrastructure side, improved the CI/CD workflow, implemented unit tests for my Lambda function and converted the CloudFormation template to SAM.</description></item></channel></rss>
