It got such a warm response from the community that I decided to write more about SAM. (and also because I just love it😍) Lets not waste more time and get into it!

If you are interested in SAM, you probably already skimmed through the Getting Started with SAM page and decided it&amp;rsquo;s way too complicated for you. Well fear none! We&amp;rsquo;ll do something much more linear here instead of that &amp;ldquo;all-in-one&amp;rdquo; deployment.
A little backstory After having deployed a complete serverless architecture with pure CloudFormation, Forrest Brazeal suggested I look into the SAM framework.</description></item><item><title>AWS - How to Host Your Own Blog (for beginners)</title><link>https://blog.heyitschris.com/posts/aws-how-to-host-your-own-blog-for-beginners/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2020 15:05:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.heyitschris.com/posts/aws-how-to-host-your-own-blog-for-beginners/</guid><description>AWS - How to Host Your Own Blog (for beginners) Having a personal blog is great for a multitude of reasons. With the #100DaysOfCloud challenge, it is especially useful for both detailing what projects you&amp;rsquo;ve done and how, as well as sharing your knowledge with other learners or with potential employers. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through all of the steps on how to create one and host it on AWS.</description></item><item><title>Hugo on AWS - S3/Cloudfront/Route53</title><link>https://blog.heyitschris.com/posts/hugo-on-aws-s3-cloudfront-route53/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 13:45:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.heyitschris.com/posts/hugo-on-aws-s3-cloudfront-route53/</guid><description>How to host a Hugo static site on AWS Serverless with CloudFormation. I built this blog with Hugo and wanted to host it on my already existing AWS S3 static site infrastructure. The problem was however that the main page loaded no problem, but anything in /posts/this-post would get an AccessDenied error. While I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out why this problem exists, I did make it work and now I&amp;rsquo;m sharing the setup here since there is no clear-cut guide on Hugo for this setup.</description></item><item><title>How it's made: This Blog</title><link>https://blog.heyitschris.com/posts/a-blog-post-about-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 16:12:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.heyitschris.com/posts/a-blog-post-about-my-blog/</guid><description>How it&amp;rsquo;s made: This Blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to have a blog. Putting my thoughts into writing has always benefitted me and I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely started paying more attention to do it as often as I can. After I completed Forrest Brazeal&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Resume Challange and had my own website running on Serverless AWS, I thought why not extend it with a blog. I wrote some articles on my Medium page as well, but seeing #100DaysOfCode &amp;amp; #100DaysOfCloud take off, I decided it&amp;rsquo;s time to make my own.</description></item><item><title>About Chris Nagy</title><link>https://blog.heyitschris.com/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2020 23:37:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.heyitschris.com/about/</guid><description>About Chris Nagy 👋🏻 Hello there [general kenobi]!

⚠️Update This was initially published on Medium. Since I created my own blog, I saw no reason not to migrate this post to this platform. Since this post was published, I have fixed all the small issues on the infrastructure side, improved the CI/CD workflow, implemented unit tests for my Lambda function and converted the CloudFormation template to SAM.</description></item></channel></rss>
