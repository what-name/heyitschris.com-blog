## About Chris Nagy

👋🏻 Hello there _[general kenobi]_! My name is Chris Nagy and I have a passion for all things that run on electricity. Batteries🔋, electric vehicles🚗, solar panels🌞, computers💻, phones📱 and the thing that ties it all together; code⌨️.

I travelled the world for the past 2 years (🇹🇭🇵🇭🇺🇸🇭🇰🇲🇴🇦🇪🇬🇧🇮🇩) and taught english in China🇨🇳 as well. I'm a supporter of the conscious consumption and use of psychedelics🍄 in order to better understand ourselves and our society. Now I'm spending my days in Germany🇩🇪 with my family.

I've worked as a 👨🏻‍💻 Junior SysAdmin for a while but had a bunch of other, completely unrelated jobs as well. I believe having experience in different fields can offer a better understanding and broader vision in all areas of life if you're willing to notice the patterns. I'm focusing on the Cloud☁ at the moment and actively learning as much as I can about it & it's surrounding topics such as DevOps, security, scalability and reliability.

I speak three languages fluently 🇺🇸🇩🇪🇭🇺 and can find beer & cigarettes in 🇪🇸. I'm interested in just about any topic and very much open to thoughtful conversations. Hit me up at chris@heyitschris.com or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chris_the_nagy) and let's chat about stuff! Human rights, tech, music, adventures, cultures, politics, weed, vaping, DIY - you name it.

🚫 What I can't stand however is a "that's alright" attitude toward the work we do. They say the devil is in the details but I like to think that the "angels are in the details". Paying attention to those tiny things that seperate okay products from truly great user experiences is a central point for me. While I admire them, this is the main reason why I won't use Microsoft products🤷🏻‍♂️.
